### Image Slider

This is a simple image slider that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive and can be used in any website. It is also very easy to use and customize. Using images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/). Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). CDN found via [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/).
